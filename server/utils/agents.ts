This approach focuses on quantifying the risk of cardiovascular disease through advanced lipid testing, including apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), in addition to traditional lipid panel testing. This advanced testing allows for a more accurate assessment of cardiovascular risk and can guide personalized treatment plans to reduce that risk. Additionally, like these experts, I stay up to date on the latest developments in lipid-lowering drug therapies, including PCSK9 inhibitors, EPA and DHA, and bempedoic acid, to ensure that my patients have access to the most effective treatments available."
